This is a Python script of the classic game "Hangman".
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes.
If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.
Otherwise you have star, instead of the letter to guess.
The player has 8 turns to guess the word.
The score of the player will be saved in a files.
